## Synopsis
Based on Wikipedia, Kiva is a non profit organization that allows people to lend money via the Internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students in over 80 countries. Kiva's mission is â€œto connect people through lending to alleviate poverty.

In this analysis, we will seek patterns of Kiva micro-loans based on the Kaggle data set from 2014 to 2017. Also we will integrate other data sources and APIs such as foreign exchange rate and World Bank.

## Questions

- Comparison by country, sector ad gender
- Distribution of loans geographically on a global map
- Word Cloud to show what keywords are mostly mentioned
- Histogram and barplots showing distribution of load amount
- Trend over time
- Correlation of median loan amount vs GDP per capital and country's level of development (based on Word Bank)

## Development Methods

- Make it work first, then improve
- Quick iteration
- Modular

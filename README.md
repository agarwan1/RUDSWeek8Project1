## Synopsis
Based on Wikipedia, Kiva is a non profit organization that allows people to lend money via the Internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students in over 80 countries. Kiva's mission is “to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty".

In this analysis, we will look into patterns of Kiva crowd-funding utlizing [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding), [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) API and Plotly (https://plot.ly/) Web Services.

## Questions

- How does the amount of loan get distributed by sector?
- Which countries get the most and least funding?
- How do loans differ between genders?
- How does the amount of loans change over time?
- Is there a correlation between loan amount vs country’s economic condition such as GDP per capita?

## Development Methods

- Make it work first, then improve
- Agile and task driven
- Fast iteration
- Modular and test driven

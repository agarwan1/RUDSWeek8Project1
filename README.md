## Synopsis
Based on Wikipedia, Kiva is a non profit organization that allows people to lend money via the Internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students in over 80 countries. Kiva's mission is â€œto connect people through lending to alleviate poverty".

In this analysis, we will look into patterns of Kiva crowd-funding utlizing [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding), [Fixer Foreign Exchange API](https://fixer.io/) and [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/).

## Questions

- Comparison by country, sector ad gender

- Trend over time
- Correlation of median loan amount vs GDP per capital and country's level of development (based on Word Bank)

## Development Methods

- Make it work first, then improve
- Fast iteration
- Modular and test driven
